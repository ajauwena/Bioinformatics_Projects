# Bioinformatics Projects

This repository hosts several bioinformatics projects. A brief outline of each project is provided below.

## Burbot Read Alignment to Reference Genomes

Assesses how reference genome and alignment software choice impacts alignment success. Aligns burbot (<em>Lota lota</em>) reads to both a fragmented burbot genome and a complete cod (<em>Gadus morhua</em>) genome with the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) and Bowtie 2 alignment software.

Uses Bash, Python, and R.

## Genomic Prediction Investigation in Ontarian Barley

Explores the factors influencing barley yields in Ontario, Canada, including genetics and the environment. Also assesses the potential of genomic prediction for estimating Ontarian barley performance.

Uses Bash and R.

## Insurance Premium Charges Prediction With Machine Learning

Evaluates the performances of various machine learning models in predicting insurance premiums charged to a policyholder. Compares the AdaBoost, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and support vector machine (SVM) regressors and classifiers.

Uses Python.

## Tutorial on Performing DAPC on Ethiopian Barley Landraces

Provides a tutorial on performing Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC) using a dataset of Ethiopian barley landrace genotypes, aiming to replicate the findings from a 2021 study.

Uses R.

## Variant Calling on Burbot Reads

Compares the performance of two variant calling software, BCFtools and Freebayes, in identifying variants within 10 burbot (<em>L. lota</em>) reads.

Uses Bash and R.
