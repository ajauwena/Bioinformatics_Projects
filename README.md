# Bioinformatics Projects

This repository hosts several bioinformatics projects. A brief outline of each project is provided below.

## Aligning Burbot Reads to Reference Genomes

Assesses how reference genome and alignment software choice impacts alignment success. Aligns burbot (<em>Lota lota</em>) reads to both a fragmented burbot genome and a complete cod (<em>Gadus morhua</em>) genome with the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) and Bowtie 2 alignment software.

Uses Bash, Python, and R.

## Clustering Individuals Using SNPs With Machine Learning

Investigates the utility of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the ZNF23, FAM135B, and Rbm38 genes as markers for differentiating between individuals from the African and East Asian superpopulations. Also compares the efficacies of four clustering algorithms in differentiating between individuals from these superpopulations using SNPs from ZNF23, FAM135B, and Rbm38.

Uses R.

## Investigating Genomic Prediction in Ontarian Barley

Explores the factors influencing barley yields in Ontario, Canada, including genetics and the environment. Also assesses the potential of genomic prediction for estimating Ontarian barley performance.

Uses Bash and R.

## Predicting Insurance Premium Charges With Machine Learning

Evaluates the performances of various machine learning models in predicting insurance premiums charged to a policyholder. Compares the AdaBoost, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and support vector machine (SVM) regressors and classifiers.

Uses Python.

## Tutorial on Performing DAPC on Ethiopian Barley Landraces

Provides a tutorial on performing Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC) using a dataset of Ethiopian barley landrace genotypes, aiming to replicate the findings from a 2021 study.

Uses R.

## Variant Calling on Burbot Reads

Compares the performance of two variant calling software, BCFtools and Freebayes, in identifying variants within 10 burbot (<em>L. lota</em>) reads.

Uses Bash and R.
